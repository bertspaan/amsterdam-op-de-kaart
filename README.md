Maps by Decade shows only large-scale maps (i.e. maps depicting an area smaller than 5 km²) that are digitized, georectified, and that are in the public domain (or of which the Library holds the copyright). You can browse other maps and atlases in NYPL's [Digital Collections](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/) and [Map Warper](http://maps.nypl.org/).
